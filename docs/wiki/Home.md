As challenged by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Ocramius/status/680817040429592576), this should extract validation
rules and filters from a html form and validate submitted user data against it.

It's pretty crazy what you have to do to get a form build. Create a lot of php classes for elements, validation,
etc. So why not build a html form and use the standard element attributes to extract the validation rules and filters.
Together with some powerful html compliant data attributes you can create forms, validation and filters in one place.
